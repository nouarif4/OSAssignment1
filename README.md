**Process Scheduling Simulator using the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.**  
This project simulates process scheduling using the Round Robin algorithm by visualizing the process execution timeline (like a Gantt chart) and calculating metrics such as CPU utilization, average turnaround time, and average waiting time.  
*(Note: We are ignoring preemption and context-switching between processes.)*
